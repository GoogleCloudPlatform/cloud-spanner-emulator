# The google java client library send PATCH methods as POSTs (with X-HTTP-Method-Override).
# The InstanceAdmin.UpdateInstance and DatabaseAdmin.UpdateDatabaseDdl methods have PATCH
# annotations in their service definition and hence the generated code for these methods does
# not work with the client library as the client library sends PATCH but the server expects POST.
#
# We use this yaml file override to accept POST for the update methods. This file is provided as
# an input to the grpc-gateway code generator. The other option is to modify the server to apply
# the method override, but it is preferable to keep the server simple.
