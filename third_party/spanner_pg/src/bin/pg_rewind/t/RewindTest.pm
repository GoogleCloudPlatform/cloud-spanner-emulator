package RewindTest;

# Test driver for pg_rewind. Each test consists of a cycle where a new cluster
# is first created with initdb, and a streaming replication standby is set up
# to follow the master. Then the master is shut down and the standby is
# promoted, and finally pg_rewind is used to rewind the old master, using the
# standby as the source.
#
# To run a test, the test script (in t/ subdirectory) calls the functions
# in this module. These functions should be called in this sequence:
#
# 1. setup_cluster - creates a PostgreSQL cluster that runs as the master
#
# 2. start_master - starts the master server
#
# 3. create_standby - runs pg_basebackup to initialize a standby server, and
#    sets it up to follow the master.
#
# 4. promote_standby - runs "pg_ctl promote" to promote the standby server.
# The old master keeps running.
#
# 5. run_pg_rewind - stops the old master (if it's still running) and runs
# pg_rewind to synchronize it with the now-promoted standby server.
#
# 6. clean_rewind_test - stops both servers used in the test, if they're
# still running.
#
# The test script can use the helper functions master_psql and standby_psql
# to run psql against the master and standby servers, respectively.
