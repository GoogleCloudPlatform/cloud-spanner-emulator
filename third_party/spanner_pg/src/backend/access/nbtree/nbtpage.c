 *	   and flag data describing page state.  The first page in a btree, page
 *	   zero, is special -- it stores meta-information describing the tree.
 *	   Pages one and higher store the actual tree data.

 * recursively).  stack is a search stack leading to it.  Note that we will
 * update the stack entry(s) to reflect current downlink positions --- this is
 * similar to the corresponding point in page split handling.
 *
 * If "first stage" caller cannot go ahead with deleting _any_ pages, returns
 * false.  Returns true on success, in which case caller can use certain
 * details established here to perform the first stage of deletion.  This
 * function is the last point at which page deletion may be deemed unsafe
 * (barring index corruption, or unexpected concurrent page deletions).
 *
 * We write lock the parent of the root of the to-be-deleted subtree for
 * caller on success (i.e. we leave our lock on the *subtreeparent buffer for
 * caller).  Caller will have to remove a downlink from *subtreeparent.  We
 * also set a *subtreeparent offset number in *poffset, to indicate the
 * location of the pivot tuple that contains the relevant downlink.
 *
 * The root of the to-be-deleted subtree is called the "top parent".  Note
 * that the leafbuf page is often the final "top parent" page (you can think
 * of the leafbuf page as a degenerate single page subtree when that happens).
 * Caller should initialize *topparent to the target leafbuf page block number
 * (while *topparentrightsib should be set to leafbuf's right sibling block
 * number).  We will update *topparent (and *topparentrightsib) for caller
 * here, though only when it turns out that caller will delete at least one
 * internal page (i.e. only when caller needs to store a valid link to the top
 * parent block in the leafbuf page using BTreeTupleSetTopParent()).
