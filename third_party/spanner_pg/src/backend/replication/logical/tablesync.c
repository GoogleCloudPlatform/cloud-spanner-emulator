 *
 * NOTES
 *	  This file contains code for initial table data synchronization for
 *	  logical replication.
 *
 *	  The initial data synchronization is done separately for each table,
 *	  in a separate apply worker that only fetches the initial snapshot data
 *	  from the publisher and then synchronizes the position in the stream with
 *	  the main apply worker.
 *
 *	  There are several reasons for doing the synchronization this way:
 *	   - It allows us to parallelize the initial data synchronization
 *		 which lowers the time needed for it to happen.
 *	   - The initial synchronization does not have to hold the xid and LSN
 *		 for the time it takes to copy data of all tables, causing less
 *		 bloat and lower disk consumption compared to doing the
 *		 synchronization in a single process for the whole database.
 *	   - It allows us to synchronize any tables added after the initial
 *		 synchronization has finished.
 *
 *	  The stream position synchronization works in multiple steps.
 *	   - Sync finishes copy and sets worker state as SYNCWAIT and waits for
 *		 state to change in a loop.
 *	   - Apply periodically checks tables that are synchronizing for SYNCWAIT.
 *		 When the desired state appears, it will set the worker state to
 *		 CATCHUP and starts loop-waiting until either the table state is set
 *		 to SYNCDONE or the sync worker exits.
 *	   - After the sync worker has seen the state change to CATCHUP, it will
 *		 read the stream and apply changes (acting like an apply worker) until
 *		 it catches up to the specified stream position.  Then it sets the
 *		 state to SYNCDONE.  There might be zero changes applied between
 *		 CATCHUP and SYNCDONE, because the sync worker might be ahead of the
 *		 apply worker.
 *	   - Once the state was set to SYNCDONE, the apply will continue tracking
 *		 the table until it reaches the SYNCDONE stream position, at which
 *		 point it sets state to READY and stops tracking.  Again, there might
 *		 be zero changes in between.
 *
 *	  So the state progression is always: INIT -> DATASYNC -> SYNCWAIT -> CATCHUP ->
 *	  SYNCDONE -> READY.
 *
 *	  The catalog pg_subscription_rel is used to keep information about
 *	  subscribed tables and their state.  Some transient state during data
 *	  synchronization is kept in shared memory.  The states SYNCWAIT and
 *	  CATCHUP only appear in memory.
 *
 *	  Example flows look like this:
 *	   - Apply is in front:
 *		  sync:8
 *			-> set in memory SYNCWAIT
 *		  apply:10
 *			-> set in memory CATCHUP
 *			-> enter wait-loop
 *		  sync:10
 *			-> set in catalog SYNCDONE
 *			-> exit
 *		  apply:10
 *			-> exit wait-loop
 *			-> continue rep
 *		  apply:11
 *			-> set in catalog READY
 *	   - Sync in front:
 *		  sync:10
 *			-> set in memory SYNCWAIT
 *		  apply:8
 *			-> set in memory CATCHUP
 *			-> continue per-table filtering
 *		  sync:10
 *			-> set in catalog SYNCDONE
 *			-> exit
 *		  apply:10
 *			-> set in catalog READY
 *			-> stop per-table filtering
 *			-> continue rep
