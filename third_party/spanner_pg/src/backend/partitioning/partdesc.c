 * deleted on its own.  To avoid leaking memory in that context in case of an
 * error partway through this function, the context is initially created as a
 * child of CurTransactionContext and only re-parented to CacheMemoryContext
 * at the end, when no further errors are possible.  Also, we don't make this
 * context the current context except in very brief code sections, out of fear
 * that some of our callees allocate memory on their own which would be leaked
