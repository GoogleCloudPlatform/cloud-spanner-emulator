/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * preptlist.c
 *	  Routines to preprocess the parse tree target list
 *
 * For INSERT and UPDATE queries, the targetlist must contain an entry for
 * each attribute of the target relation in the correct order.  For UPDATE and
 * DELETE queries, it must also contain junk tlist entries needed to allow the
 * executor to identify the rows to be updated or deleted.  For all query
 * types, we may need to add junk tlist entries for Vars used in the RETURNING
 * list and row ID information needed for SELECT FOR UPDATE locking and/or
 * EvalPlanQual checking.
 *
 * The query rewrite phase also does preprocessing of the targetlist (see
 * rewriteTargetListIU).  The division of labor between here and there is
 * partially historical, but it's not entirely arbitrary.  In particular,
 * consider an UPDATE across an inheritance tree.  What rewriteTargetListIU
 * does need be done only once (because it depends only on the properties of
 * the parent relation).  What's done here has to be done over again for each
 * child relation, because it depends on the properties of the child, which
 * might be of a different relation type, or have more columns and/or a
 * different column order than the parent.
 *
 * The fact that rewriteTargetListIU sorts non-resjunk tlist entries by column
 * position, which expand_targetlist depends on, violates the above comment
 * because the sorting is only valid for the parent relation.  In inherited
 * UPDATE cases, adjust_inherited_tlist runs in between to take care of fixing
 * the tlists for child tables to keep expand_targetlist happy.  We do it like
 * that because it's faster in typical non-inherited cases.
