// This file contains no code.
// It is used as a source file for header-only libraries
// to force blaze to build them and their dependencies.
// (Blaze considers a target trivially up-to-date if it has no source
// files to build, which means it doesn't build its dependencies, which
// breaks transitive header dependencies.)
