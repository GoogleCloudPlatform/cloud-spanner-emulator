src/tools/msvc/dummylib

This directory contains just enough of a dummy library to allow checking of
the programs in src/tools/msvc and src/tools/win32tzlist.pl with
perl -cw, even on machines that lack the Win32 perl infrastructure.

invoke via:

PERL5LIB=src/tools/msvc/dummylib perl -cw $file

This is the only use that should be made of this directory. Attempting actually
running of any programs using this library will result in a lot of grief.
