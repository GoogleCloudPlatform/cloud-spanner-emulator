Regression tests for subscription/logical replication
=====================================================

This directory contains a test suite for subscription/logical replication.

Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install"
(including installing the hstore extension).  In that case, the code
in the installation tree is tested.  With "make check", a temporary
installation tree is built from the current sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops several test Postgres
clusters.
