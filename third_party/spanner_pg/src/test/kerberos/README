Tests for Kerberos/GSSAPI functionality
=======================================

This directory contains a test suite for Kerberos/GSSAPI
functionality.  This requires a full MIT Kerberos installation,
including server and client tools, and is therefore kept separate and
not run by default.

Also, this test suite creates a KDC server that listens for TCP/IP
connections on localhost without any real access control, so it is not
safe to run this on a system where there might be untrusted local
users.

Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops a test Postgres
cluster, as well as a test KDC server.

Requirements
============

MIT Kerberos server and client tools are required.  Heimdal is not
supported.

Debian/Ubuntu packages: krb5-admin-server krb5-kdc krb5-user

RHEL/CentOS/Fedora packages: krb5-server krb5-workstation

FreeBSD port: krb5 (base system has Heimdal)
