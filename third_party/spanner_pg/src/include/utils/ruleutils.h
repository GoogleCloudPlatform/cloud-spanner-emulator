/*
 * Per-relation data about column alias names.
 *
 * Selecting aliases is unreasonably complicated because of the need to dump
 * rules/views whose underlying tables may have had columns added, deleted, or
 * renamed since the query was parsed.  We must nonetheless print the rule/view
 * in a form that can be reloaded and will produce the same results as before.
 *
 * For each RTE used in the query, we must assign column aliases that are
 * unique within that RTE.  SQL does not require this of the original query,
 * but due to factors such as *-expansion we need to be able to uniquely
 * reference every column in a decompiled query.  As long as we qualify all
 * column references, per-RTE uniqueness is sufficient for that.
 *
 * However, we can't ensure per-column name uniqueness for unnamed join RTEs,
 * since they just inherit column names from their input RTEs, and we can't
 * rename the columns at the join level.  Most of the time this isn't an issue
 * because we don't need to reference the join's output columns as such; we
 * can reference the input columns instead.  That approach can fail for merged
 * JOIN USING columns, however, so when we have one of those in an unnamed
 * join, we have to make that column's alias globally unique across the whole
 * query to ensure it can be referenced unambiguously.
 *
 * Another problem is that a JOIN USING clause requires the columns to be
 * merged to have the same aliases in both input RTEs, and that no other
 * columns in those RTEs or their children conflict with the USING names.
 * To handle that, we do USING-column alias assignment in a recursive
 * traversal of the query's jointree.  When descending through a JOIN with
 * USING, we preassign the USING column names to the child columns, overriding
 * other rules for column alias assignment.  We also mark each RTE with a list
 * of all USING column names selected for joins containing that RTE, so that
 * when we assign other columns' aliases later, we can avoid conflicts.
 *
 * Another problem is that if a JOIN's input tables have had columns added or
 * deleted since the query was parsed, we must generate a column alias list
 * for the join that matches the current set of input columns --- otherwise, a
 * change in the number of columns in the left input would throw off matching
 * of aliases to columns of the right input.  Thus, positions in the printable
 * column alias list are not necessarily one-for-one with varattnos of the
 * JOIN, so we need a separate new_colnames[] array for printing purposes.
