 * MAXPGPATH: standard size of a pathname buffer in PostgreSQL (hence,
 * maximum usable pathname length is one less).
 *
 * We'd use a standard system header symbol for this, if there weren't
 * so many to choose from: MAXPATHLEN, MAX_PATH, PATH_MAX are all
 * defined by different "standards", and often have different values
 * on the same platform!  So we just punt and use a reasonably
 * generous setting here.
