# Bootstrap Catalog
# Makes PostgreSQL system table data (pg_type, pg_proc, etc.) available to
# Spanner PG shims and transformer code. This package is separate from other
# shim packages because it needs to directly include PostgreSQL src files
# instead of the standard postgres_includes package used elsewhere.
